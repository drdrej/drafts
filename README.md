#Goals
first of all drafts is a working name for libraries and microframeworks around android to make my life as android app developer easier.
all this code should simplify android development of native (business and utility) apps.

What does it mean?
* simplify state-management in an app
* try to be performant
* write less, do more
* more contracts, less code 

#Structure
